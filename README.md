**The project uses a stack:**

- `Python 3.9, Pytest 7.1.2, Selenium 4.2.0, Page Object pattern, Docker, Jenkins`

**How to start:**

Use Python 3.9 + Create and activate virtual environments

`python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate`

Run in terminal

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

and start all tests

`pytest -s -v .\tests\tests_search_page_suggested.py`

**Addition:**

_I write tests through the app because it shortens the declaration of the pages, it is more intuitive for me_
